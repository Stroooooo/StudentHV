# StudentHV Project

**StudentHV** is a management tool designed for colleges and schools, enabling students to create, manage, and connect to their own **Hyper-V virtual machines** from a simple web interface.  
The system prevents students from easily tampering with each other's work during class time.

Originally built for the **computing floor at NESCol**, StudentHV is now free and open for anyone to use, modify, and adapt to their own environment.

With a few simple adaptations, this project can serve as an internal management system for a company's Hyper-V servers or any other controlled lab environment.
